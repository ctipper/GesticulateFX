# GesticulateFX, a freehand drawing app

An app for sketching freehand diagrams. GesticulateFX is not geared towards graphic design and is intended to be used for more casual scenarios where it is required to be able to sketch an idea with some notation and then to be able to export to a variety of formats.

It supports vector shapes, curve-fitted lines and images. Text editing is planned.
