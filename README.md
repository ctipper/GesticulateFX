# GesticulateFX, a freehand drawing app

An app for sketching freehand diagrams. GesticulateFX is not geared towards graphic design and is intended to be used for more casual scenarios where it is required to be able to sketch an idea with some notation and then to be able to export to a variety of formats.

It supports vector shapes, curve-fitted lines, images may be pasted or imported from shell and there is a mapping component.

To build `JAVAFX_HOME` environment variable needs to be set and uses the latest JDK release. Platform builds are in the site directory using `ant` script. This assumes that JDK is in `~/Applications` folder.
